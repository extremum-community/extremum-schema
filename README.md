# About

This repository contains common data schemas of the [Extremum Project](http://extremum.io). These schemas are used in its core services, API, and derived products. You can read more about Extremum in its [official documentation for developers](https://docs.extremum.io). You can freely use any schemas from this repository in your own projects (with or without Extremum) by referencing or replicating them.

## Schema formats
