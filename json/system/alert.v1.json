  "description": "Every alert attached to the response header provides information about occuring errors, potential problems and system events, that should be properly handled by the requester for smoother user experience 😉\n\n### Alert level \n\nEvery alert is issued with a certain severity level, explained below:\n\n|*Level*|*Description*|\n|---|---|\n|**fatal**|A serious failure affecting application stability.|\n|**error**|An error or unexpected condition, which lead to an action failure, but doesn't affect the whole application.|\n|**warn**|Indication of a potential problem.|\n|**info**|Informational message that highlight the progress of an action at coarse-grained level.|\n|**debug**|Designates fine-grained informational events and detailed information on the flow through the application and involved third-party systems, which is most useful to debug an application.|\n|**trace**|Designates finer-grained information than the *debug* level, including internal system events. *Available only for on-premises configurations*.|\n\nThe alerts of severity below *'warn'* are not reported by default. These levels are available only for development and issue resolution purposes and require corresponding traceability enabled for the requester.\n\n### Alert code \n\nThe numeric code of alert designates a certain type of alert and specific conditions it is issued for.\n\n### Alert details \n\nThe attributes supplying details of the alert provide various helpful information for its proper handling. \n\n|*Attribute*|*Description*|\n|---|---|\n|timestamp|The date and time when the corresponding event occured.|\n|element|Points to a certain *element* of interation, which is related to the alert.|\n|message|A localized wording explaining the occured event.|\n|link|A URL of some reference documentation about the situation highlighted by the alert.|\n|traceId|A special reference Id that may be used for finding this alert in system trace log.|\n\nSome useful best practices for proper handling of errors and warnings can be found here — <http://www.userjourneys.com/blog/ux-guidelines-for-error-handling/>."
